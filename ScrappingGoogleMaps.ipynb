    "## Steps\n",
    "#### API keys\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of scrapping the webpage GoogleMaps (which Google does not allow: they will ban your IP adress if they realize you created a scrapping algorithm that block their servers).\n",
    "\n",
    "So we must use their API service on [Google Developers webpage](https://developers.google.com/). \n",
    "\n",
    "First we need to get a API key for the API we want to use. Each Google Maps Web Service request requires an API key or client ID. API keys are freely available with a Google Account at https://developers.google.com/console. The type of API key you need is a Server key.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get an API key:\n",
    "\n",
    "Visit https://developers.google.com/console and log in with a Google Account.\n",
    "+ Select one of your existing projects, or create a new project.\n",
    "+ Enable the API(s) you want to use. The Python Client for Google Maps Services accesses the following APIs:\n",
    " + Directions API\n",
    " + Distance Matrix API\n",
    " + Elevation API\n",
    " + Geocoding API\n",
    " + Geolocation API\n",
    " + Places API\n",
    " + Roads API\n",
    " + Time Zone API\n",
    "+ Create a new Server key.\n",
    "\n",
    "The information provided by each key is given on both the google developer page and the help page (link given before).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Second you need to install the google map package for python on your machine. From a Jupyter Notebook this is you line you want:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pip\n",
    "!pip install -U googlemaps\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### To know before creating your algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the challenge is to build big data skims. For instance I had 200x200 OD matrix, assuming the duration of the trip depend on the direction of this trip, it is 40'000 API requests required to populate my OD mat. The problem is, if you use free Google Maps API requests, you have a daily threshold of request: 2500 requests per day and per API key, and you can have up to 12 keys on a single account ie. you can request max 30'000 information per day. So I needed to run my algorithm on two diferent days to populate my entire OD mat.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I created 10 keys, and I loop over my API keys to not being blocked. You can also get a paying plan [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/pricing-and-plans/). Do the simultation, It's can be super expensive!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Go ahead!\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now take a look to the script I created to populate two OD mat in the same api request. I used the Distance Matrix API, with mode \"driving\" and the desired departure time during morning peak of a random weekday \"datetime.datetime(2017, 4, 3, 8, 30, 0, 0)\". The Distance MAtrix API returns a lot of info (see help page) but I juste wanted (a) the distance and (b) the duration. Since I requestes at 0830 in the morning, I will get the expected trip duration in trafic conditions."
